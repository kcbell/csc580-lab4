kkSolver.py is the main program. Usage is:

python kkSolver.py [-c] [FILENAME...]

The -c option means the program will read one puzzle per line. Otherwise, it 
reads one puzzle per file. If no files are specified, it reads from stdin.

It prints out the solution for each specified puzzle, each separated by a 
newline.

kkPuller.py can be used to pull Knights and Knaves puzzles from the example web
site.
